### About My Work

I'm a dedicated **Python developer** and **hosting specialist** with a unique background in systems administration and large-scale network management. My experience isn't just in codeâ€”it's in the entire stack, from managing bare-metal servers to scaling production environments.

* **Founder & Entrepreneur:** I built and ran **HostingKarle**, a successful hosting provider, from the ground up.
* **Systems & Virtualization:** I have extensive experience with **Proxmox** and **Docker**, and I'm skilled in managing **VPS**, **Ubuntu**, and **Debian** servers.
* **Game Server Architect:** I have deep knowledge of what it takes to run high-traffic game servers, including **Minecraft**, **GTA**, **FiveM**, and **RAGE:MP**.
* **Team Collaboration:** Iâ€™ve worked on multiple projects as a staff member for various companies and collaborated with big teams to deliver complex systems.
